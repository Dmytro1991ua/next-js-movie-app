# Movie Room
Welcome to the `Movie Room` project, a platform where you can explore a vast collection of movies and TV series using The Movie Database (TMDB) API. Additionally, this project features a custom backend powered by MongoDB for managing your movie preferences, such as adding to favorites or applying a custom ration to a particular movie/TV serial, updating the user's profile data, etc.

## Motivation

This project is a labor of love that originated from the desire to gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge web development technologies and tools. I set out with several goals in mind:

- `Learn Next.js 12`: Next.js is a powerful and popular framework for building React applications. By using Next.js 12, I aimed to explore its latest features and capabilities.

- `Implement Authentication with Next Auth`: Security and user authentication are crucial aspects of any web application. I chose Next Auth to simplify the implementation of authentication and user management.

- `Utilize The Movie Database (TMDB) API`: Leveraging external APIs, like TMDB, allowed us to work with real-world data, create engaging user experiences, and learn about API integration.

- `Practice MongoDB with Mongoose`: Building a custom backend with MongoDB and Mongoose was an opportunity to delve into database design, schema modeling, and data persistence and provide a way to handle some specific project's features in a custom way and not depend on a third parties libraries and tools implementations.

- `Explore Modern Web Development Patterns, tools, and libraries`: Throughout the project, I aimed to adhere to best practices and modern development patterns, including component-based architecture responsive design, etc. Apart from that, one of the main goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge web development technologies and tools.

Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to explore new technologies or a beginner eager to get your hands dirty with web development, I genuinely hope this project serves as a valuable resource and a source of inspiration.
